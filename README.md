# Major Project - 15CS496L "Analysis and Future Risk Prediction of Diabetes Melltius"

This is the repository for my B.Tech Major Project (15CS496L). In this project I have applied various Machine and Deep Learning algorithms and also developed a Hybrid Algorithm to create an intelligent prediction model for predicting the future risk of diabetes as well as I have designed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the same model. I have achieved an accuracy of 90.6% with my Hybrid Algorithm. The code for my model is in the folder Main and the file name is main.ipynb and the GUI file name is Hybrid_Model_GUI.py. I have also uploaded the project report in the Main folder that I have submitted to my college SRM Institute of Scienece and Technology for partial fulfillment of the degree.
